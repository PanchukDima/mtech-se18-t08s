			    <p><img src="images/content_photo_1.jpg" width="213" height="185" border="0" class="imageright" />Poverty happens when people forget to care for their fellowmen. It is a   consequence of our collective failure to be our brother and sister's keeper.   Content with our own lives and our circle of family and friends, we overlook the   needs of our neighbor, failing to recognize that we are part of one big family.   To love ourselves is to also care for other people's needs, to be afforded the   same opportunities that have been given us.<br />
			    </p>
			  <img src="images/content_photo_2.jpg" width="201" border="0" class="imageleft" /><p>When   disasters strike, it is always the landless poor who often fall victim because   they are forced to squat in makeshift houses on top of steep slopes, riverbanks,   and shorelines. They are constantly exposed to storm surges, landslides and   floods. In urban areas, many poor families live under bridges, on top of   unstable landfills, and in flood prone areas.<br />
			     <br />
			    Each year, natural   disasters occur in varying intensities. They leave a trail of property damages,   loss of lives, and displaced families. Because of these, the government ends up   spending millions every year in relief and rehabilitation. And to make this   perennial problem worse, the recent climate change brings forth natural   disasters that are more unpredictable and with unprecedented magnitude. <br />
